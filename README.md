Writing down recipes and learning HTML

I have created a small recipe site with some recipes for the upcoming week. 
On the recipe pages the recipes are easy to read, since the ingredients and the directioons are separated.
I have added pictures for the visual part.
I added one link to products, but in the future I might add more.
